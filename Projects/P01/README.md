###### Program 01 - Game: Game
Due: 2-23-2021 (Tuesday @ 9:30 a.m.)
###### Overview:
Follow instructions for this first program without adding functionality or personalized touches for now. We will be organizing our code and applying some OOP techniques on subsequent assignments. So, keep it bare bones for now.

Using the code snippets for help here, and the SFML documention write a program (game) that does the following:

#### Player
Is a circle shape
But could be another shape or sprite (later).
Size is configurable
Color is configurable
Starting location also configurable
However for this "game" player starts at middle left of screen.
Moves up and down (1 direction only for now) using up and down arrows (additional keys can be set to do same thing).
A player can however possibly move other directions as well (in later installments).

#### Debris
Is a rectangle shape
But could be another shape or sprite (later).
Size is configurable
Color is configurable
Starting location also configurable
Moves them from right to left starting at a random Y location just off right side of screen.
The size should be random between some min and max value.
The speed should also be random set between some min and max value.
The frequency and speed should slowly increase over time. Enough that after ONE minute of play, it should be impossible


#### Scoring
When a Player comes collides with Debris score is negatively effected.
When a piece of Debris leaves game screen (on the left), score is positively effected.

#### Text Output:
Score gets displayed somewhere on the screen.
Font is configurable.
Location is configurable.
Color is configurable.
Size is configurable.
#### NOT DONE
