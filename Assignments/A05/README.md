## Definitions



#### Class
> the definition of a class is essential like a blueprint to make other objects. For example you have the blueprint
>of a car and want to make more, creating a class is a way to create more object( cars).

#### Object
> The definition of an object is an individual item that is created from ablueprint(class) in C++. when you create an
>object in C++, it utilizes the specified class it pertains to a creates a unique item ( car1, car2, truck, etc.)

#### Method
> these are functions that are inside of a class that tell the class what to do and what values to set each instance to when creating 
> and object as well as things like default values.)


#### Abstraction
> the definition of abstraction in C++ is the creation of a functionality of a created class, but details that are unnecessary are 
> not shown to the user.

#### Attributes / Properties
> attributes and properties in C++ are used to provide some additional info that enforces the set constriants, used for optimizing and performing certain
>tasks if need be in code.

#### Class Variable
> a class variable is any instance of a stand alone single declared name that can be of any specified data type

#### Composition
> one or more of the objects of a certain class have a relationship with other classes. an example of this is a string object.



#### Constructor
> this is a method inside a class that is automatically called whenever an object of the class is created ( i.e. default constructor for 
>default values


#### Encapsulation
> encapsulation is a process that combines data member and functions togeter into a single item
> which is referred to more commonly as class, which in turn prevents direct access to this data
> Although, access to these items and data members are done through the functions of those classes

#### Friends
> A friend function in a class is defined outside of that sepcified classes scop, however,
> this has all rights given to it of all the private and public members of that class. This appears inside
> the class definition but is not a member function.
> can be a function, templated function, class, class function in which all members are friends :)


#### Inheritance
> the definition of inheritance in c++ is the process in which an object acquires all the properties
> and the stated behaviours that are associated with that. This is particulularly ueful when the 
> user wants to modify certain things inside another class but still keep the original without modification

#### Instance Variable
> instance variables are not static. they are variables that are declared in a class outside of 
> all methods, constructor or blocks. these are created whenever objects of a class is created and 
> then destroyed


#### Member Variable
> member variables are variables that are static and are declared inside of the class. These are found
> inside the Private of Public sections of a class.

#### Multiple Inheritance
> this refers to inheriting traits from more than one parent object or class. When this is done,
> these inherited traits are called in the order in which they are made.

#### Overloading
> this lets you define a method several time with different sets of argument lists.
> this is most common in a class, with defauly constructor, a user desfined default constructor.\
> this also alows the user to perform arithmetic operations like ( %, +, - etc) this can even be used 
> with addition of multiple objects.


#### Polymorphism
> this is the ability of an object to take several forms. This is a term that describes the basic principle
> in which different classes are able to be used withing the system and provide their own
> individual implementation.



#### Public / Private / Protected
> These are going to be access modifiers which allow the user to discern when and where and how the user is 
>            able to access data through encapsulation.

>"Public" - Any class can access this portion of a class outside of itself

>"Private" - Means that only the current class of friends of that class have access 

>"Protected" - means that only the current class and the subclasses of that specified class
>              have access to the protected fields or methods


#### Static
> these are things in coding such as variable that are initialized once in the program and retain
> their value throughout the entirety of the program and they are not changed.


#### Virtual
> this allows a program to call methods that dont "really" exsit upon compilation. This
> also refers to the inheritable and functions that are able to be over riden in which are dynamically
> dispatched.
